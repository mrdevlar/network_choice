    "How do we simulate binary choices in a network?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're talking about a choice on a single idea, it appears correct to simulate such interactions using a Bernoilli, Binomial and Beta distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's define the actors in our play:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bernouilli Distribution\n",
    "Let us define a random variable, $X$, where $P(X = 1) = p$ and $P(X = 0) = 1 - p$, where 1 stands for an accepting choice and 0 stands for a rejecting choice. This is the Bernoulli distribution, and it defines the probability of a single choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial Distribution\n",
    "If we extend the Bernoulli to a series of independent choices, we will note that we will have a certain proportion of acceptances and rejections. The probability for any specific sequence of $k$ acceptances and $n-k$ rejections will be $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ and there will be $\\binom{n}{k}$ such sequences. Thus, letting $X$ be the number of acceptances:\n",

    "$$P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "for $k = 0,1,...,n$ and $P(X=k) = 0$ otherwise\n",
